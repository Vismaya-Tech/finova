youtube,"TCS CEO laid off associates worked in the company for a long time, and also who was with the company for almost 30 years, and just 1.5 years to complete tenure for the retirement. They Supported company during many difficult situations, and also kept on aligning and learning for any new assignment during their tenure. Suddenly, they asked to leave one day and, they relieved them within 2-3 days. It is a big shocking news for them. I am sure, CEO don’t have any view on how HR, handles situation, which is very bad, but HR & CEO will get this year good appraisal and hike.
I have few queries, 
1 An employee aged 58 years, going to retire within 1.5 years, how he is connected to AI learning, even if company asked him, he might have learned AI fast compare to outsiders as per company’s instruction. What CEO going to get, by sending 58 years aged employee out of the company. In that case, he should have released or sent out all the 58 aged associates in the company.
2 HR handled very badly, associates worked in the company around 30 years experienced are treated badly. Why CEO not correcting them. Can CEO take action on HR, who handled badly associates.
3 Only associates influential and connect to CEO or Big Bosses are not touched. Why? 
4 Is that HR or CEO, thought, how it will affect each associate family, and their family situation, Afterall, Mankind should be taken care compare to any thing in the world.

They hire people with the hope of growth, but due to poor planning and strategy—or after a crisis—they end up laying off employees just to boost their own shares, salaries, and bonuses. It’s unclear what they actually learn during their MBA after waste of money and time and earning a bogus degree, which increasingly feels like a degree used only to secure a hefty pay package. Why hire so many people if you're uncertain about the future? If you can't support your employees during tough times, then what's the point of claiming that TCS is one of the best service companies in the world? 
This TCS CEO himself is not confident about his own company and seems clueless about what the next 5 to 10 years will look like. He throws out vague numbers without any confidence and really does not know what would happen in the technology field. In another 3 to 4 years, this same person will likely impose harsh measures on employees due to his lack of vision and poor strategy—and once again, the employees will bear the cost.
